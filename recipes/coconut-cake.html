    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a super simple recipe that you can make for a delicious dessert. You can mix the batter in a single bowl!
        On top of that, it only takes a few simple ingredients to make. This is a must have dish for those who love
        coconut and for those who do not like complex dishes. The cake itself offers a moist texture that is great on
        its own, allowing you to substitute with just powdered sugar if you are not a big coconut fan. An all around
        great dish that has many more positives than negatives.</p>

        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the glaze</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>1/4 cup of powdered sugar, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon water, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with butter and then line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a small, microwave-safe bowl, add the butter.</li>
        <li>Microwave for 20 seconds, then in 10-second increments until the butter is melted, stirring after every 10
            second increment.</li>
        <li>Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, add the shredded coconut and sugar. Blend for 15 seconds until the coconut
            looks finely ground.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the melted butter, blitzed coconut and sugar, sour cream, coconut milk, eggs, and a 1/4
            cup of water, and whisk until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Use a sifter or fine-mesh sieve over the bowl to sift the flour, baking powder, and salt right on top of the
            wet ingredients.</li>
        <li>Gently whisk until the batter is combined, being careful to not overmix or stir too vigorously.</li>
        <li>Use a rubber spatula to scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50-55 minutes. </li>
        <li>Transfer the pan onto a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lower the oven temperature to 325&deg;F for the topping.</li>
        <li>On a foil-lined baking sheet, evenly spread 1/2 cup of shredded coconut.</li>
        <li>Bake it for 3 minutes, stir and spread it, then bake it for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from baking sheet and let cool.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon water. Glaze should be runny, so add more water if
            needed.</li>
        <li>Use a pastry brush to brush the top of a cake with the glaze.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle toasted coconut evenly over the cake and dust top with more powdered sugar if desired.</li>
        <li>Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 4-5 days.</li>
    </ol>
