    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blackened shrimp tacos involve a blend of various different cultures including Creole, southern, and hispanic
        methods of cooking. The true star of this dish is the blackened seasoning. Blackened seasoning consists of a mix
        of dried herbs and spices that gives meat a charred, brown look. This also provides a delicious, somewhat spicy
        flavor to die for. Tacos are a perfect way to get to know this flavor as tacos are a great food to mix and match
        diffrent ingredients to really highlight the power of the blackened seasoning.</p>
